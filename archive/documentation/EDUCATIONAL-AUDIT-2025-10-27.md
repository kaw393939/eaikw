---

## Recommendations for Enhancement

### Priority 1: Time Estimate Accuracy

**Current Issue:** Stated times (3-5 min) don't match actual completion time
(10-40 min).

**Solution:** Update lesson headers to:

```markdown
‚è±Ô∏è **Time:**

- Reading: 8 min
- Practice: 20 min
- Total: ~30 min
```

**Impact:** Sets realistic expectations, reduces student frustration.

---

### Priority 2: Video Walkthroughs

**Current Gap:** Text-only instruction may not suit all learning styles.

**Solution:** Create 5-10 minute Loom/YouTube videos for each lesson showing:

- Live demonstration of commands
- What to watch for in terminal output
- Common errors and fixes
- Instructor commentary

**Impact:** Adds visual/auditory learning modality, benefits visual learners
significantly.

---

### Priority 3: Glossary of Terms

**Current Gap:** Technical terms explained in context, but no central reference.

**Solution:** Create `docs/reference/glossary.md` with:

- Alphabetical listing of terms
- Plain English definitions
- Link to lesson where term is introduced
- Related terms cross-references

**Impact:** Supports review, aids non-native speakers, serves as study guide.

---

### Priority 4: Knowledge Checks

**Current Gap:** No formal assessment of learning.

**Solution:** Add end-of-lesson multiple-choice questions (5 per lesson):

- No grades, just feedback
- Answers reveal gaps in understanding
- Link to relevant section for review

**Example:**

```markdown
## üß† Knowledge Check

1. What does Eleventy use as input files? a) HTML files b) Markdown files ‚úÖ c)
   PDF files d) Word documents

   **Explanation:** Eleventy reads Markdown files from `src/` and converts them
   to HTML.
```

**Impact:** Validates learning, identifies areas needing review.

---

### Priority 5: Community Features

**Current Gap:** Individual learning experience, no peer interaction built in.

**Solution:**

- Add Discord/Slack invite to README
- Create "Show & Tell" section in GitHub Discussions
- Weekly "Bug Bash" where students debug together
- Student showcase gallery

**Impact:** Builds community, peer learning, motivation through social
connection.
