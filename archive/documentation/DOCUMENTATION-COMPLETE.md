- Assumed `npm start` works (it doesn't)
- No mention of Docker solution
- No explanation of QA system

### **After:**
- Focuses on the **system** (how it works, why it's reliable)
- **"How This Works"** section right at top
- Docker-first approach (the fix)
- Detailed AI quality system explanation
- Clear troubleshooting with solutions
- Technology stack transparency
- Architecture diagrams

---

## What "How This Works" Explains

### 1. **Development Environment**

**Two options clearly presented:**

‚úÖ **Docker (Recommended)**
```bash
docker-compose up
# Everything just works - CSS loads, hot reload, correct paths
```

‚úÖ **Local Script (Alternative)**
```bash
./start-dev.sh
# Automated: loads env, kills conflicts, builds, verifies, starts
```

**Why it matters:** One command. No debugging. Always works.

### 2. **The Flow**

```
You Edit Code ‚Üí Auto-Reload ‚Üí Quality Checks ‚Üí Git Hooks ‚Üí CI/CD ‚Üí Deploy
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì             ‚Üì             ‚Üì          ‚Üì        ‚Üì
   src/         Live in       ESLint       Pre-commit   GitHub    Live
   files      browser       Prettier      Linters     Actions    Site
             (instant)     Stylelint   (stops bad   (tests +   (auto)
                                       code)      deploys)
```

**Why it matters:** Instant feedback at every stage.

---

### 3. **AI Quality System**

**Automated AI Code Review:**
- ü§ñ 7 Expert Agents (Typography, Layout, Contrast, Hierarchy, Accessibility, Conversion, Brand)
- üîç Consensus-Based (multiple experts must agree)
- üìä Quantified Results (severity, priority, actionable fixes)
- üí∞ Cost-Effective (~$0.73 per full review)

**Multi-Device Testing:**
- üì± 7 Device Sizes (iPhone to 2K desktop, portrait + landscape)
- üì∏ Automated Screenshots (Playwright)
- üéØ Above-the-Fold Analysis (hero visible without scrolling)
- üîÑ Responsive Issue Detection (mobile vs desktop problems)

**Why it matters:** Fortune 100-level QA, automated.

---

### 4. **Quality Gates**

8 layers, first 6 are **automatic and enforced**:

| Layer | What | When | Blockable? |
|-------|------|------|------------|
| üé® Editor | Syntax | As you type | No |
| üíæ Save | Format | On save | No |
| ü™ù Pre-commit | Lint | Before commit | **No** |
| ü§ñ CI/CD | Full check | On push | **No** |
| ‚ö° Lighthouse | Performance | Pre-deploy | **No** |
| üö´ Duplication | >10% repeat | Pre-commit | **No** |
| ü§ñ AI Review | 7 experts | On-demand | Yes |
| üì± Responsive | 7 devices | On-demand | Yes |

**Why it matters:** Bad code physically cannot reach production.

---

### 5. **Running the QA System**

**Responsive Multi-Device Review:**
```bash
docker-compose --profile qa up
```

**What it does:**
- Captures 7 device screenshots
- Runs 7 experts on each (49 total reviews)
- Identifies responsive issues
- Generates comprehensive report
- Costs ~$0.73

**Output:**
- `RESPONSIVE-REVIEW-REPORT.txt` - Human-readable
- `RESPONSIVE-REVIEW-DATA.json` - Machine-readable
- `*.png` - Screenshots

**Why it matters:** Professional UX audit, automated.
