## 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities in Dependencies

**Severity:** HIGH **Category:** Security **Risk:** Potential security exploits

**Details:**

- 12 vulnerabilities detected (5 low, 7 high)
- Found during `npm install` output

**Impact:**

- Production site could be vulnerable to known exploits
- High-severity vulnerabilities need immediate attention

**Recommendation:**

```bash
# Review vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Attempt automatic fixes
npm audit fix

# For breaking changes (test thoroughly first)
npm audit fix --force
```

**Effort:** 1-2 hours **Priority:** Address within 48 hours

---

### 2. Outdated Dependencies - Major Versions Behind

**Severity:** HIGH **Category:** Maintenance **Risk:** Missing features,
security patches, and potential incompatibilities

**Current vs. Latest:** | Package | Current | Latest | Gap |
|---------|---------|--------|-----| | `@11ty/eleventy` | 2.0.1 | 3.1.2 | 1
major version | | `eslint` | 8.57.1 | 9.38.0 | 1 major version | | `husky` |
8.0.3 | 9.1.7 | 1 major version | | `lint-staged` | 15.5.2 | 16.2.6 | 1 major
version |

**Impact:**

- Missing security patches
- Missing performance improvements
- Potential compatibility issues with newer tools
- ESLint 9 has breaking changes

**Recommendation:**

1. Update minor/patch versions first: `npm update`
2. Test major updates one at a time
3. Review breaking changes for Eleventy 3.x and ESLint 9.x
4. Create a separate branch for major updates

**Effort:** 4-6 hours **Priority:** Schedule within 2 weeks

---

### 3. VS Code Settings Configuration Errors

**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH **Category:** Configuration **Risk:** Non-functional
VS Code workspace settings

**Details:**

- 6 instances of invalid `editor.defaultFormatter` settings
- References `esbenp.prettier-vscode` which is not in the valid extensions list
- Settings will be ignored by VS Code

**Location:** `.vscode/settings.json` lines 4, 26, 29, 32, 35, 38

**Impact:**

- Auto-formatting may not work as expected
- Inconsistent developer experience
- Settings are silently ignored

**Recommendation:** The extension ID is actually valid but needs to be installed
first. This is a false positive from VS Code validation, but the extension needs
to be listed in the workspace recommendations and users need to install it.

**Action Required:**

1. Ensure Prettier extension is installed
2. The settings will work once extension is installed
3. Consider adding installation check to documentation

**Effort:** 30 minutes **Priority:** Document in setup guide

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### 4. GitHub Actions Secret Warning

**Severity:** MEDIUM **Category:** Configuration **Risk:** CI/CD pipeline may
fail

**Details:**

- Line 103 in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- References `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` secret that may not be defined
- Context access warning from GitHub Actions validator

**Impact:**

- Lighthouse CI job will fail if secret is not configured
- Pipeline will succeed but skip Lighthouse checks
- False sense of quality assurance

**Recommendation:**

1. Document secret requirement in README
2. Make Lighthouse CI optional or add fallback
3. Add instructions for obtaining and setting the token
4. Consider using `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` as fallback

**Effort:** 1 hour **Priority:** Address before first deployment

---

### 5. Missing Test Coverage

**Severity:** MEDIUM **Category:** Quality Assurance **Risk:** Bugs may slip
through

**Details:**

- No unit tests configured
- No integration tests
- `npm test` only runs linters + build
- No test framework installed

**Impact:**

- Cannot verify functionality programmatically
- Reliance on manual testing
- Regression bugs more likely

**Recommendation:**

1. Add Jest or Vitest for unit testing
2. Create tests for utility functions
3. Add E2E tests with Playwright for critical paths
4. Update `npm test` to include test runs

**Effort:** 4-8 hours initial setup **Priority:** Consider for future
enhancement

---

### 6. No Environment Configuration

**Severity:** MEDIUM **Category:** Configuration Management **Risk:** Hard-coded
values, no dev/prod separation

**Details:**

- No `.env` file or environment variable usage
- Site URL hard-coded in `src/_data/site.json`
- No differentiation between dev/staging/prod

**Impact:**

- Cannot easily configure for different environments
- Local development uses production URLs
- Manual configuration changes needed for deployment

**Recommendation:**

1. Create `.env.example` file
2. Add `dotenv` package
3. Use environment variables for site URL and other config
4. Update `.eleventy.js` to read from environment

**Effort:** 2 hours **Priority:** Before scaling to multiple environments

---

### 7. Deprecated Warnings in Dependencies

**Severity:** MEDIUM **Category:** Maintenance **Risk:** Future compatibility
issues

**Details:** From `npm install` output:

- `inflight@1.0.6` - deprecated, memory leaks
- `rimraf` versions prior to v4 (multiple instances)
- `@humanwhocodes/config-array` and `object-schema` - use `@eslint/*` instead
- `glob@7.2.3` - versions prior to v9 no longer supported
- `eslint@8.57.1` - version no longer supported

**Impact:**

- Transitive dependencies from other packages
- Will need to be addressed when updating parent packages
- Potential security and stability issues

**Recommendation:**

- Update ESLint to v9 (major update, test carefully)
- Other deprecations will resolve when updating parent packages
- Monitor for updates

**Effort:** Included in dependency update effort **Priority:** Bundle with
dependency updates

---

### 8. Console.log in Production Code

**Severity:** LOW-MEDIUM **Category:** Code Quality **Risk:** Performance
impact, exposed debug info

**Details:**

- `src/assets/js/main.js:21` has console.log with eslint-disable
- Comment says "can be removed in production" but it's still there

**Impact:**

- Minor performance overhead
- Debug information visible in production
- Goes against own ESLint rules

**Recommendation:**

1. Remove the console.log and eslint-disable comment
2. Or use a proper logging library with log levels
3. Configure build process to strip console in production

**Effort:** 5 minutes **Priority:** Clean up before v1.0 release

---

## 🟢 LOW PRIORITY ISSUES

### 9. No Package-lock.json Version Lock

**Severity:** LOW **Category:** Configuration **Risk:** Inconsistent builds

**Details:**

- Using `^` (caret) for all dependency versions in `package.json`
- Allows minor/patch updates automatically
- Could lead to "works on my machine" issues

**Impact:**

- Different developers might get different versions
- CI/CD might install different versions than local
- `package-lock.json` mitigates this but risk remains

**Recommendation:**

- Current approach is standard and acceptable
- Consider exact versions for production-critical dependencies
- Ensure `package-lock.json` is committed (already done ✓)

**Effort:** No action needed **Priority:** Monitor only

---

### 10. Missing robots.txt and sitemap.xml

**Severity:** LOW **Category:** SEO **Risk:** Sub-optimal search engine indexing

**Details:**

- No `robots.txt` file
- No `sitemap.xml` file
- Missing from Eleventy build

**Impact:**

- Search engines may not index optimally
- Cannot control crawling behavior
- Missing SEO best practices

**Recommendation:**

1. Add `robots.txt` to `src/` directory
2. Install `@quasibit/eleventy-plugin-sitemap`
3. Configure sitemap generation in `.eleventy.js`
4. Add to passthrough copy

**Effort:** 30 minutes **Priority:** Before public launch

---

### 11. No 404 Page

**Severity:** LOW **Category:** User Experience **Risk:** Poor user experience
on broken links

**Details:**

- No custom 404 error page
- GitHub Pages will use default 404
- Missing from current setup

**Impact:**

- Users see generic GitHub 404 page
- No way to guide users back to site
- Unprofessional appearance

**Recommendation:**

1. Create `src/404.md` with custom error page
2. Style consistently with site theme
3. Include navigation back to homepage
4. GitHub Pages will automatically use it

**Effort:** 30 minutes **Priority:** Nice to have

---

### 12. Limited Accessibility Testing

**Severity:** LOW **Category:** Quality Assurance **Risk:** Accessibility issues
not caught

**Details:**

- Lighthouse CI tests accessibility (good!)
- No axe-core or pa11y integration
- Manual accessibility testing recommended

**Impact:**

- May miss some accessibility issues
- Lighthouse catches most issues but not all
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance not guaranteed

**Recommendation:**

1. Add `@axe-core/cli` to dev dependencies
2. Create npm script: `"test:a11y": "axe http://localhost:8080"`
