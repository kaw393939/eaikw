## 🎯 Our Mission

To teach developers how to **collaborate with AI coding assistants** while
maintaining professional code quality standards through automated testing and
quality gates.

---

## 💡 Why This Course Exists

**The Problem:** AI coding assistants are powerful, but they generate code that
often duplicates existing code, lacks consistent formatting, contains subtle
bugs, and violates best practices.

**The Solution:** This course teaches you to use **automated quality gates**
that catch these issues before deployment. You learn to work WITH AI, not
blindly trust it.

## 🏗️ What Makes This Different

### 1. Self-Paced, Not Passive

Hands-on practice in every lesson with knowledge checks, real projects you can
deploy, and no video lectures to fall asleep through.

### 2. Quality-First, Not Quality-Later

Quality gates run BEFORE commits (not after). Automation catches errors
immediately. Bad habits prevented, not fixed later.

### 3. AI-Augmented, Not AI-Replaced

You control the AI. Learn prompt engineering as a skill, verify AI output with
automated checks, and understand principles beyond just tools.
