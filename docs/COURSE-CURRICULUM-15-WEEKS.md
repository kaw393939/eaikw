## Detailed Weekly Breakdown

### **WEEK 0: Foundations - AI as Superpower & Strategic Framework**

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understand AI as discovery (not just technology) and its historical
  significance
- Grasp how AI gives you superpowers through vocabulary and strategic thinking
- Learn practical LLM concepts: context windows, tokens, and effective prompting
- Develop framework for translating challenges into solutions

**Topics:**

1. **AI as Discovery, Not Technology**

   _Historical Parallels:_
   - **Printing Press (1440s):** Democratized knowledge, transformed society
   - **Electricity (1880s-1920s):** Enabled entirely new industries and
     lifestyles
   - **Internet (1990s-2000s):** Collapsed geography, created digital economy
   - **AI/LLMs (2020s-present):** Augments human cognition, democratizes
     expertise

   _Jevons Paradox in History:_
   - **Coal:** More efficient steam engines → more coal consumption, not less
   - **Computing:** Faster processors → more complex software, not simpler tasks
   - **Internet:** Faster connections → more data usage, not less time online
   - **AI Pattern:** Better tools → exponentially more intellectual work, not
     less thinking

   _The Discovery Pattern:_
   - Initial discovery → Experimentation → Applications → Resistance →
     Acceleration → Transformation → New normal
   - Where we are now: Stages 3-5 (early acceleration phase)
   - Window to become early adapter still open

   _Why "Discovery" Matters:_
   - Technologies can be controlled; discoveries transform everything
   - Society reorganizes around discoveries
   - Understanding this shapes your strategy

2. **Your AI Superpowers Explained**

   _Three Core Superpowers:_
   - **Superhuman Reading:** Process and synthesize vast information instantly
   - **Superhuman Writing:** Generate, refine, iterate content at unprecedented
     speed
   - **Superhuman Translation:** Convert between domains (idea → code, concept →
     design, challenge → solution)

   _The Critical Catch - The Vocabulary Gap:_
   - AI can only be as precise as your instructions
   - Without professional vocabulary: Generic, mediocre output
   - With professional vocabulary: Precise, professional results
   - **Formula:** Superpower = AI Tools + Professional Vocabulary + Strategic
     Thinking

   _Example of Vocabulary Advantage:_

   ```
   Without Vocabulary: "Make my website look better"
   → AI gives generic improvements

   With Vocabulary: "Improve visual hierarchy: the CTA lacks prominence.
   Increase contrast between primary and secondary actions. The type scale
   needs more differentiation between H2 and body text."
   → AI gives precise, professional improvements
   ```

   _Magic Words: Professional Tactics & Tools_
   - **Strategic Frameworks:** "Technical debt audit," "5 Why analysis," "MVP
     iteration"
   - **Design Precision:** "Elegant solution," "Information architecture,"
     "Progressive disclosure"
   - **Business Strategy:** "Conversion optimization," "Value proposition
     canvas," "Customer journey mapping"
   - These aren't just vocabulary—they're **strategic weapons** that unlock AI's
     professional capabilities

   _The AI Manager Paradigm:_
   - **Reality Check:** You can't out-dig a backhoe, out-race a Bugatti, or
     out-calculate Excel
   - **AI Parallel:** You can't beat AI for instant knowledge access, idea
     synthesis, writing, reading, or coding
   - **The Shift:** We don't do less intellectual work—we do exponentially more
     (Jevons Paradox)
   - **Your New Role:** Strategic director of AI capabilities, not manual
     executor
   - **Core Skills:** Professional vocabulary + Good taste + Agency + Strategic
     thinking

3. **Understanding LLMs: Practical Framework**

   _What Is an LLM?_
   - Statistical system trained on massive text datasets
   - Predicts likely next words based on learned patterns
   - "Autocomplete on steroids" that learned from reading most of the internet
   - Not magic - sophisticated pattern matching

   _Critical Concept: Context Window_
   - AI's "working memory" - limited amount of information it can "see" at once
   - Measured in tokens (chunks of text)
   - Everything you say + everything it generates fills this window
   - When full, AI "forgets" earliest information
   - **Practical Implication:** Manage context like a budget

   _Understanding Tokens:_
   - Roughly: 1 token ≈ 0.75 words
   - 100 words ≈ 133 tokens
   - Context windows: GPT-4 (128K tokens ≈ 96K words)
   - Longer prompts = fewer responses before context fills
   - **Strategy:** Be economical with words

   _Why LLMs Make "Mistakes":_
   - Hallucinations: Pattern-match false info confidently
   - Recency bias: Training data has cutoff date
   - Context confusion: Mix up earlier conversation points
   - No common sense: No real-world experience
   - **Your Job:** Be the strategic thinker; AI is your assistant

4. **Strategies for Effective Prompting**

   _The Vocabulary Advantage Framework:_
   - **Step 1:** Define challenge in professional vocabulary
   - **Step 2:** Break into specific, actionable sub-problems
   - **Step 3:** Prompt AI with precise terminology and constraints

   _Example: Website Conversion Problem_

   ```
   ❌ Beginner: "How do I get more customers from my website?"
   → Generic SEO and social media advice

   ✓ Strategic:
   Step 1: "I need to increase conversion rate. Current: 1000
   visitors/month, 2% inquiry rate. Issues: unclear value proposition,
   weak CTA prominence, no social proof."

   Step 2: Break down: value prop clarity, CTA hierarchy, trust signals

   Step 3: Precise prompts:
   - "Review my value prop using StoryBrand framework"
   - "Analyze visual hierarchy. Primary CTA should be most prominent.
     Suggest changes: color contrast, size, placement, white space"
   - "Recommend 3 types of social proof for consulting business,
     prioritized by conversion impact"

   → Specific, actionable, professional improvements
   ```

   _The 4 C's of Effective Prompting:_
   - **Clear:** Use precise terminology
   - **Contextual:** Provide relevant background
   - **Constrained:** Set specific parameters
   - **Checkable:** Request verifiable outputs

5. **Managing Context Strategically**

   _Context Budget Mindset:_
   - You have fixed amount (context window)
   - Every interaction "spends" tokens
   - Manage wisely for best results

   _Strategies for Long Projects:_
   - **System Prompt:** Set professional role at start
   - **Focused Sessions:** Break work into: brand → design → content → technical
   - **Summarize & Resume:** Before hitting limits, ask AI to summarize
     decisions
   - **External Storage:** Save key outputs in your own files, don't rely on AI
     memory

6. **Why Professional Vocabulary Multiplies Your Power**

   _The Multiplication Effect:_
   - Without vocabulary: AI is 2x helpful
   - With vocabulary: AI is 10x-100x helpful
   - **This course teaches the vocabulary that unlocks the multiplier**

   _What You'll Learn:_
   - **Design Vocabulary** (Week 3): Typography, layout, color, UI/UX
     terminology
   - **Psychology Vocabulary** (Week 2): Cialdini, cognitive biases, archetypes
   - **Business Vocabulary** (Weeks 9, 11-15): Value props, conversion, customer
     journey
   - **Technical Vocabulary** (Weeks 4-8): Git, CI/CD, performance,
     accessibility

   _Before vs. After This Course:_
   - Before: "Make my site professional" → generic output
   - After: "Apply Sage archetype with authority positioning. Improve visual
     hierarchy: CTA needs prominence through size, contrast, white space.
     Incorporate Cialdini's reciprocity principle in hero" → professional,
     strategic output

**Hands-On Reflection Exercise:**

- Write about which historical discovery resonates most and why
- Identify your current vocabulary gap in your chosen domain
- Describe a time AI gave mediocre results - how could vocabulary have helped?
- Choose one context management strategy to practice
- Commit to learning one vocabulary area from this course

**AI Prompting Practice:**

- Prompt AI to explain any concept from this lesson in depth
- Practice the 3-step translation: Challenge → Vocabulary → Sub-problems →
  Precise prompts
- Start a "vocabulary notebook" to track professional terms you learn

**Key Takeaways:**

- AI is a discovery that transforms society, not just a technology
- Your superpower = AI + professional vocabulary + strategic thinking
- Context is limited - manage it like a budget
- Vocabulary multiplies AI's value exponentially
- You remain the strategist - AI is your assistant, not your replacement

### **WEEK 2: Psychology of Online Behavior & Persuasion**

**Learning Objectives:**

- Master Cialdini's 6 principles of persuasion
- Understand cognitive biases in online decision-making
- Learn archetypal branding (Jung, Campbell)

**Topics:**

1. **Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion**
   - **Reciprocity:** Free value, then ask (lead magnets, free trials)
   - **Scarcity:** Limited time offers, countdown timers
   - **Authority:** Credentials, media mentions, certifications
   - **Consistency:** Small commitments lead to bigger ones
   - **Liking:** Similarity, compliments, cooperation
   - **Consensus:** Social proof, testimonials, user counts

2. **Cognitive Biases in E-Commerce**
   - Anchoring effect (original price vs. sale price)
   - Loss aversion (fear of missing out - FOMO)
   - Choice overload (analysis paralysis)
   - Social proof (others bought this, reviews, ratings)
   - Decoy effect (pricing tiers)

3. **Archetypal Branding**
   - **12 Jungian Archetypes:** Hero, Sage, Creator, Caregiver, Ruler, Magician,
     Lover, Jester, Everyman, Innocent, Explorer, Rebel
   - Brand personality and voice
   - Consistency across touchpoints
   - Attracting resonant customers

   - First impressions (50ms to judge)
   - Cognitive load and simplicity
   - Visual hierarchy and attention
   - Trust signals and credibility
   - Color psychology in branding
   - Typography and readability

5. **The Principle of Self-Evident Design**
   - **Core Insight:** Users are on their own—no one is there to help
   - **Designer's Job:** Anticipate needs, answer questions preemptively, guide
     without being present
   - **User Expectations:** Things should "just work" without explanation
   - **Psychological Safety:** Clear affordances reduce anxiety, increase
     confidence
   - **Feedback Loops:** Users need confirmation their actions worked
   - **Error Recovery:** When things go wrong, users need a path forward

**Connection to Persuasion:**

Clear, self-evident design builds TRUST (Cialdini's Authority principle):

- "This site knows what it's doing" → Professional credibility
- "I can figure this out" → User feels smart (Liking principle)
- "This is safe to use" → Reduces friction to action

Confusing design breaks trust:

- "What does this button do?" → Hesitation
- "Did that work?" → Anxiety
- "How do I undo this?" → Fear of mistakes

**Assignments:**

- Identify archetype of 5 major brands (Apple, Nike, etc.)
- Analyze one e-commerce site: What persuasion techniques are used?
- Define your personal brand archetype
- **NEW:** User test exercise: Watch someone use a website for the first time
  (record their screen and audio). Document: Where do they pause? What do they
  click that doesn't work? What questions do they ask? Create report on
  self-evidence failures.

### **WEEK 3: Professional Web Design Vocabulary & Visual Communication**

**Learning Objectives:**

- Master professional design terminology
- Understand design principles and patterns
- Learn to evaluate and critique design effectively
- Prompt AI with professional design language

**Topics:**

1. **Design Principles (Fundamentals)**
   - **Balance:** Symmetrical, asymmetrical, radial
   - **Contrast:** Size, color, typography, space
   - **Hierarchy:** Visual importance, order, flow
   - **Alignment:** Grid systems, visual connections
   - **Proximity:** Grouping related elements
   - **Repetition:** Consistency, rhythm, branding
   - **White space:** Breathing room, focus, elegance

2. **Typography Vocabulary**
   - Typeface vs. font
   - Serif vs. sans-serif vs. monospace
   - Font pairing principles
   - Type scale and hierarchy (H1-H6, body, captions)
   - Line height (leading), letter spacing (tracking), kerning
   - Readability vs. legibility
   - Web-safe fonts vs. web fonts

3. **Color Theory & Systems**
   - Color wheel: Primary, secondary, tertiary
   - Color harmony: Complementary, analogous, triadic
   - Color psychology (red = urgency, blue = trust)
   - Accessibility: Contrast ratios (WCAG standards)
   - Color systems: Hex, RGB, HSL
   - Brand color palettes (primary, secondary, neutral)

4. **Layout & Grid Systems**
   - Grid types: Column grids, modular grids, hierarchical
   - Container, row, column structure
   - Gutters and margins
   - Responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - F-pattern and Z-pattern reading flows
   - Above the fold vs. below the fold

5. **UI/UX Vocabulary**
   - **UI Components:** Buttons, forms, cards, modals, navigation
   - **UX Patterns:** Onboarding, checkout flow, search, filters
   - **Interaction states:** Hover, active, focus, disabled
   - **Affordances:** Visual clues for interaction
   - **Call-to-action (CTA):** Primary, secondary, tertiary
   - **Wireframes vs. mockups vs. prototypes**

6. **Professional Critique Language**
   - "The hierarchy is unclear" (not "it looks bad")
   - "The contrast ratio fails WCAG AA" (not "hard to read")
   - "The CTA lacks visual prominence" (not "button is boring")
   - "The type scale needs more differentiation" (not "text is small")

**AI Prompting Integration:**

- "Review this design as a Fortune 100 marketing executive"
- "Critique this site as a professional brand consultant"
- "Evaluate this layout using design principles: balance, hierarchy, contrast"
- "Suggest improvements for accessibility and WCAG compliance"

7. **Self-Evident Communication**

**The Designer's Responsibility:**

Design must achieve the user's goal when **no one is there to help or provide
additional information**. The user depends entirely on you, the designer, to
guide them through the process.

**Why This Matters:**

- Your site must work at 2am when you're asleep
- Users don't read instructions—they expect things to just work
- Confusion = abandonment = lost opportunities
- Clear, self-evident design = conversions

**The Three Communication Layers:**

1. **Visual Affordances** (What can I do here?)
   - Buttons look clickable (shadows, hover states, visual weight)
   - Links are underlined or distinctly colored
   - Interactive elements respond to hover/focus
   - Disabled elements appear grayed out
   - Forms show required fields before submission

2. **Information Architecture** (Where am I and where can I go?)
   - Clear navigation hierarchy
   - Breadcrumbs show location
   - Progress indicators for multi-step processes
   - Consistent layout patterns
   - Obvious escape routes (back, cancel, close)

3. **Feedback & Guidance** (Did my action work? What happens next?)
   - Loading states for async actions
   - Success messages after submission
   - Error messages that SOLVE problems ("Use format: name@example.com")
   - Empty states with clear next actions
   - Confirmation before destructive actions

**Common Self-Evidence Failures:**

❌ **Mystery Meat Navigation:** Icons without labels ✅ **Clear Signposts:**
Icons + text labels

❌ **Hidden Interactions:** Hover-only menus with no visual clue ✅ **Visible
Affordances:** Show what's possible upfront

❌ **Generic Errors:** "Error occurred" ✅ **Actionable Guidance:** "Email
already registered. [Log in] or use different email."

❌ **Assumptive Design:** Using jargon users don't know ✅ **Plain Language:**
Write for humans, explain when needed

❌ **Silent Actions:** Button clicked, no visible response ✅ **Immediate
Feedback:** Loading state, then success confirmation

**The Golden Rule:**

> "If you have to explain how to use it, the design has failed."

Your interface is the only teacher. Users are on their own. Design accordingly.

7. **Design Systems: Philosophy & Selection**

**What is a Design System?**

- Comprehensive set of design standards, components, and guidelines
- Single source of truth for visual language
- Ensures consistency across all touchpoints
- Accelerates development through reusable components
- Examples: Material Design (Google), Human Interface Guidelines (Apple), Carbon
  (IBM)

**Why Design Systems Matter:**

- **Consistency:** Users recognize patterns, reducing cognitive load
- **Efficiency:** Build faster with pre-designed components
- **Quality:** Professional standards baked into the system
- **Scalability:** Easy to maintain and expand
- **Collaboration:** Shared vocabulary for designers and developers

**Our Design System: RISD-Inspired Educational Framework**

- **Self-Evidence Audit:** Test 2 websites with someone unfamiliar. Document
  where they get confused, what they click that doesn't work, what questions
  they ask. Identify self-evidence failures.
- **Affordance Fix Exercise:** Take a poorly designed button/form/navigation.
  Redesign it to be self-evident using: visual affordances, clear labels,
  feedback states.
- Compare 3 design systems (ours, Bootstrap, Material Design) - document
  pros/cons for educational use case
- Customize one design token (color, spacing, or type scale) in our system and
  document your reasoning

**Example: "Tell me about a time you worked on a challenging team project"**

**Situation:** "In my web development course, I was assigned to a 4-person team
to build an e-commerce site for a local coffee shop. We had 5 weeks and needed
to use professional development workflows."

**Task:** "I was the project manager, responsible for coordinating the team,
managing our GitHub workflow, and ensuring we met all technical requirements
including 90+ Lighthouse scores."

**Action:** "I set up our GitHub repository with issue templates, established
our code review process, and created a sprint schedule. When conflicts arose
over design decisions, I facilitated team discussions and helped us reach
consensus using our team charter."

**Result:** "We delivered the project on time with all requirements met. Our
site achieved 96% Lighthouse performance, implemented all 6 Cialdini persuasion
principles, and our team collaboration was so effective that our instructor used
our GitHub workflow as an example for future classes."

**Final Deliverables:**

- Live e-commerce site (fully functional)
- GitHub repository (well-documented, clean history)
- Testing report (all checks passed)
- Presentation (slides + live demo)
- Project report (10-15 pages)
- Individual reflections (1-2 pages per student)
- Case study for portfolio
- **NEW: Updated LinkedIn profile and resume incorporating course skills**
- **NEW: 3 STAR method interview stories prepared**

**Grading Criteria:**

- Site functionality and quality (30%)
- Psychology and persuasion implementation (20%)
- Accessibility and performance (20%)
- Team collaboration (GitHub workflow) (15%)
- Presentation quality (10%)
- Documentation (5%)
