## 🚨 Important Concepts

### **Web Presence vs. Just a Website**

**Why it matters:**

- 🎯 Attracts people who resonate with your values
- 📖 Guides all design and content decisions
- 💡 Examples: Hero (challenger), Sage (expert), Creator (innovator)

### **Cialdini's 6 Principles of Persuasion**

**The principles:**

1. **Reciprocity** - Give value first
2. **Scarcity** - Limited availability creates urgency
3. **Authority** - Credentials and expertise build trust
4. **Consistency** - People align actions with stated values
5. **Liking** - We say yes to people we like
6. **Consensus** - Social proof validates decisions

converts
