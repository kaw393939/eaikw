⏱️ **Time:** 3 minutes 📚 **Level:** Beginner 🎯 **Goal:** Understand what
you're building and why it matters

---

## 🚀 TL;DR

You're going to build a **production-ready website** using **AI coding
assistants**, while learning to maintain **professional code quality
standards**. Think of it like having a senior developer pair-programming with
you.

---

## 🤔 What Problem Does This Solve?

### The Old Way:

```
You → Type code manually → Make mistakes → Debug for hours
```

### The AI Way (Without Quality Gates):

```
You → Ask AI → Get code → Ship it → Breaks in production 💥
```

### The Smart Way (This Project):

```
You → Prompt AI → Auto-check quality → Fix issues → Ship confidently ✅
```
