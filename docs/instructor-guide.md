1. Intentionally write bad code together (missing semicolons, unused variables)
2. Commit and watch pre-commit hooks block it
3. Fix errors as a class
4. Celebrate successful commit!

**Time:** 20 minutes

**Learning outcome:** Errors are normal and fixable

---

### Activity 2: "DRY Detective" (Lesson 5 + Duplication)

**Goal:** Identify code duplication and refactor

**How it works:**

1. Show website with duplicated CSS (3 buttons with identical styles)
2. Students identify duplication
3. Refactor together using CSS classes
4. Run duplication checker to verify 0% duplication

**Time:** 15 minutes

**Materials provided:** Example "bad" code in
`docs/examples/duplication-demo.md`

---

### Activity 3: "Prompt Engineering Challenge" (Lesson 3)

**Goal:** Practice writing effective AI prompts

**How it works:**

1. Give students a task: "Create a contact form page"
2. Students write prompts for AI assistant
3. Share prompts and compare results
4. Discuss what made some prompts more effective

**Time:** 30 minutes

**Assessment:** Quality of generated code and clarity of prompt

---

### Activity 4: "Pipeline Debugging Race" (Lesson 8)

**Goal:** Practice reading CI/CD logs and fixing issues

**How it works:**

1. Instructor pushes intentionally broken code
2. Students race to:
   - Identify which job failed
   - Read the error logs
   - Determine the fix
   - Submit solution via GitHub issue

**Time:** 25 minutes

**Prize ideas:** GitHub stickers, "CI/CD Master" badge

---

### Activity 5: "Lighthouse Optimization Competition" (Lesson 9)

**Goal:** Apply performance optimization techniques

**How it works:**

1. Start with low-scoring page (large images, no alt text, poor SEO)
2. Students compete to improve Lighthouse score
3. Share optimization strategies
4. Highest score wins

**Scoring:**

- Performance: 40%
- Accessibility: 30%
- Best Practices: 15%
- SEO: 15%

**Time:** 45 minutes

---

## üìä Assessment Ideas

### Formative Assessment (During Course)

**Option 1: Knowledge Checks**

- Use the built-in knowledge check quizzes (Lesson 5 has example)
- Students self-assess understanding
- No grades, just feedback

**Option 2: Weekly Check-ins**

- Brief surveys: "What's one thing you learned this week?"
- Identify struggling students early
- Adjust pace as needed

**Option 3: Code Review Discussions**

- Students post their commits to discussion board
- Peer review: "I like...", "I wonder...", "What if...?"
- Instructor highlights exemplary work

---

### Summative Assessment (End of Course)

**Option 1: Portfolio Project (Recommended)**

**Assignment:** Build a personal website with:

- At least 3 pages
- Quality gates passing (0% duplication, all linters)
- Deployed via GitHub Pages
- Lighthouse scores: 90+ across all categories

**Rubric:**

| Criteria          | Points | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Setup for Instructors

### Before First Class:

1. **Fork the repository** to your organization account
2. **Test the full workflow** yourself (takes ~2 hours)
3. **Create example "bad" code** for debugging activities
4. **Prepare troubleshooting** sheet with common student errors

### Recommended Tools:

- **GitHub Classroom** - Auto-create repos for each student
- **Discord/Slack** - Quick Q&A and peer support
- **Zoom/Teams** - For live coding demos
- **GitHub Discussions** - Async Q&A attached to repo

---

## üé§ Lecture/Presentation Ideas

### Week 1: "Why AI Won't Replace Developers"

**Thesis:** AI generates code, but humans ensure quality

**Talking points:**

- Show AI-generated code with duplication
- Demonstrate how quality gates catch it
- Discuss future of AI-native development

**Activity:** Students generate code with ChatGPT, then run through quality
gates

---

### Week 4: "The Economics of Code Quality"

**Thesis:** Technical debt costs more to fix later than prevent now

**Talking points:**

- Cost of bugs in production vs. development
- Time saved by automated testing
- Career value of quality-focused skills

**Activity:** Calculate time saved by pre-commit hooks (students estimate manual
checks)

---

### Week 8: "Modern Developer Workflow"

**Thesis:** Professional developers use automation, not manual testing

**Talking points:**

- What companies actually use (CI/CD is standard)
- Portfolio value of this project
- Transferable skills to other tech stacks

**Guest speaker idea:** Invite local developer to talk about their CI/CD setup

## üí° Tips for Success

### Do:

‚úÖ **Test everything yourself first** - Run through all lessons before assigning
‚úÖ **Share your own struggles** - Normalize that instructors make errors too ‚úÖ
**Celebrate small wins** - First successful commit, first deployed site ‚úÖ
**Encourage experimentation** - "Break things and fix them" mindset ‚úÖ **Provide
real-world context** - Connect lessons to job skills

### Don't:

‚ùå **Rush through setup** - Week 1 is critical for success ‚ùå **Skip the
"why"** - Students need context, not just instructions ‚ùå **Ignore struggling
students** - Identify them early in Week 2-3 ‚ùå **Grade harshly on first
attempts** - Focus on learning, not perfection ‚ùå **Forget to update links** -
Run link checker before each term!
