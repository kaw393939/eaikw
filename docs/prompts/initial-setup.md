├── package.json └── .eslintrc.json

```

Explain what each directory and file does.
Keep explanations to 1-2 sentences each.
```

#### What You'll Get:

- Quick overview of project structure
- Purpose of each key file
- How files work together

---

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

#### Prompt:

```
I want to run my Eleventy site locally for development.

My package.json has these scripts:
- "start": "eleventy --serve"
- "build": "eleventy"
- "test": "npm run lint"

Which command starts the dev server?
What URL do I visit in my browser?
How do I stop the server?
```

#### What You'll Get:

- `npm start` command
- localhost URL
- How to stop (Ctrl+C)

---

### Step 5: Verify Quality Tools Work

#### Prompt:

```
My project has ESLint, Prettier, Stylelint, and pre-commit hooks set up.

How do I test that each tool is working correctly?
Provide specific commands to run each tool.
What output indicates success vs errors?
```

#### What You'll Get:

- Commands to test each linter
- How to interpret results
- What "passing" looks like

---

## 🎨 Customization Prompts

### Customize Site Metadata

#### Prompt:

```
I need to update my Eleventy site's metadata in src/_data/site.js

Current values are placeholder text. I want to change:
- title: "[YOUR_SITE_TITLE]"
- description: "[YOUR_DESCRIPTION]"
- author: "[YOUR_NAME]"
- url: "[YOUR_GITHUB_PAGES_URL]"

Show me the updated site.js file with my values.
Explain what each field is used for in the templates.
```

**Remember to replace `[BRACKETS]` with your actual information!**

---

### Update pathPrefix for Your Repository

#### Prompt:

````
I forked the repository to my GitHub account: [YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]
My repository name is: [YOUR_REPO_NAME]

The .eleventy.js file has:
```javascript
pathPrefix: "/is117_ai_test_practice/";
````

What should I change this to for my forked repository? Why does Eleventy need
this for GitHub Pages?

```

**Example:** If your username is `janedoe` and repo is `my-eleventy-site`, your pathPrefix should be `/my-eleventy-site/`

---

### Enable GitHub Pages

#### Prompt:

```

I pushed my Eleventy site to GitHub at:
<https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPO_NAME]>

GitHub Actions is configured to deploy the site.

How do I:

1. Enable GitHub Pages for this repository
2. Set the source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Find my deployed site URL
4. Verify the deployment worked

Provide step-by-step instructions with screenshots locations.

```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Prompts

### If npm install Fails

#### Prompt:

```

I ran `npm install` and got this error:

[PASTE YOUR FULL ERROR MESSAGE HERE]

My environment:

- Operating System: [macOS/Windows/Linux]
- Node.js version: [run `node --version`]
- npm version: [run `npm --version`]

What's causing this error and how do I fix it?

```

---

### If Dev Server Won't Start

#### Prompt:

```

I ran `npm start` but the dev server won't start.

Error message: [PASTE ERROR HERE]

Expected: Server should start on <http://localhost:8080> Actual: [WHAT'S
HAPPENING]

How do I fix this?

```

---

### If Pre-commit Hook Blocks Commit

#### Prompt:

```

I tried to commit my changes with `git commit -m "my message"` but the
pre-commit hook blocked it with these errors:

[PASTE ERROR OUTPUT]

How do I:

1. Understand what these errors mean
2. Fix them automatically if possible
3. Verify the fixes before committing again

```

---

### If GitHub Actions Fails

#### Prompt:

```

I pushed to GitHub but the Actions workflow failed.

Workflow: [quality-checks / build / lighthouse / deploy] Error log: [PASTE
RELEVANT SECTION]

My pathPrefix in .eleventy.js: "[YOUR_PATH_PREFIX]" My GitHub Pages settings:
[describe settings]

What went wrong and how do I fix it?

```

---

## 🔧 Configuration Prompts

### Customize ESLint Rules

#### Prompt:

```

My .eslintrc.json currently has these rules: [PASTE YOUR CURRENT CONFIG]

I want to:

- [CHANGE_1: e.g., "Allow console.log in development"]
- [CHANGE_2: e.g., "Enforce semicolons"]
- [CHANGE_3: e.g., "Set max line length to 100"]

Show me the updated configuration. Explain what each rule change does.

```

---

### Add More File Types to Prettier

#### Prompt:

```

My .prettierrc currently formats JavaScript, CSS, and Markdown.

I want to also format:

- [FILE_TYPE_1: e.g., JSON]
- [FILE_TYPE_2: e.g., YAML]

How do I:

1. Update Prettier configuration
2. Update .lintstagedrc.json to format these in pre-commit
3. Test that it works

```

---

### Customize Husky Hooks

#### Prompt:

```

My project uses Husky for pre-commit hooks.

Current pre-commit hook runs: lint-staged

I want to also run:

- [TASK_1: e.g., "Run tests"]
- [TASK_2: e.g., "Check for large files"]

How do I update .husky/pre-commit to include these? Will this slow down commits
significantly?

```
