# Reference

This folder holds design, development, accessibility, and SEO reference
materials for the project.

Suggested files:

- `design-guidelines.md` — visual system, spacing, color tokens, typography
- `accessibility.md` — WCAG checks, keyboard patterns, ARIA usage
- `seo.md` — meta tag patterns, structured data, sitemap guidance
- `dev-notes.md` — build scripts, local dev tips, common troubleshooting

Add other reference files as needed. Keep items short and authoritative — this
is the single place contributors should look for how to keep the site
consistent.
